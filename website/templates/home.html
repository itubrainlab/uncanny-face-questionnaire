<h1>Survey on: <br/> Perception of animated video game characters</h1>

<h3>
    How do we react to different styles of characters?
</h3>

        <p>
            There are a myriad of ways to animate characters in computer games and movies.
        </p>
        <p>
            To better understand how people react to these different characters, 
            we have made a survey with pictures from different well-known movies and games.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can greatly help our work by answering a few questions about some of the characters. 
            The questionnaire only takes 10 minutes with the option of continuing, if you have the time.

    Project description
</h3>
<p>
    This survey is part of a bigger project on the perception of animated faces.
    The answers from this survey is going to be used for an EEG study, where we record
    brain activity of people looking at these characters. 
</p>
    
<p>
    The project is part of my (Laurits Dixen) PhD project, supervised by Paolo Burelli.
